# Bike Light
Principles of Engineering Lab 1: Bike Light.

This (lab assignment)[http://poe.olin.edu/lab1.html] involves building electrical and software systems to interface with an arduino and distance sensor - this allowed for practice with interfacing with analog and digital data, using interrupts, and managing multiple inputs.

To learn more or run this code, see the attached lab report. The actual .ino file can be flashed onto an Arduino UNO with appropriate peripherals as detailed in the attached report and source code.
